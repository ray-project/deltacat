    TODO discuss "Block" terminology.

    This data structure represents a set of data blocks which have to be traversed
     together, because rows in the block is in an overlapping key range

    The data and key ranges within a BlockGroup can be processed in parallel during a scan

    Each block may show up in many BlockGroups. This is because as soon as the combination of blocks in the group
    change, it becomes a different group.

    Take the following example: A dataset has Field Group 1 (FG1) and Field Group 2 (FG2). The SSTs rows look like below:

    Field group 1     Field group 2
    ------------------|---------------
    [0,100] -> Block1 | [0-10]  -> Block4
    [3-90]  -> Block2 | [0-100] -> Block5
    [10-95] -> Block3 |

    If we want to scan this data, we can index of off the SST rows into an interval tree and observe the following
    "boundaries" in the interval tree:

    BlockGroup1 - Covers rows [0-3), includes Blocks 1,4,5
    BlockGroup2 - Covers rows [3-10), includes Blocks 1, 2, 4, 5
    BlockGroup3 - Covers rows [10-90), includes Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4*, 5
    BlockGroup4 - Covers rows [90-95), includes Blocks 1, 2*, 3, 5
    BlockGroup5 - Covers rows [95-100], includes Blocks 1, 3*, 5
    *special case - interval end==block group start

    Creating a sorted list of BlockGroups like this allows us to know exactly which blocks contain records
    for any given point query, range query, or scan. For instance, if the user queries for key=3, we know
    to read BlockGroup1, or key[0-10] to read BlockGroup1+BlockGroup2.

        The IntervalTree boundary table contains each boundary where the set of intervals change
        This function traverses the boundary table and builds a list

        Edge case - incompatibility with Interval Tree Library

        Note that the IntervalTree Library treats ALL ranges as min=inclusive, max=non-inclusive
        This is a different from our SSTables, where min_key and max_key are both inclusive.

        As a suboptimal workaround, we can fix this by adding an SSTRow to an interval when the
        SST row's max key is equal to the lower bound of the interval. Take the following example:

        Field group 1     Field group 2
        ------------------|---------------
        [0,100] -> Block1 | [0-10]  -> Block4
        [3-90]  -> Block2 | [0-100] -> Block5
        [10-95] -> Block3 |

        Our workaround adds for example Block4 to the interval [10,90), because Block4 is inclusive
        of key 10 but the IntervalTree library thinks it is non-inclusive.

        BlockGroup1 - Covers rows [0-3), includes Blocks 1,4,5
        BlockGroup2 - Covers rows [3-10), includes Blocks 1, 2, 4, 5
        BlockGroup3 - Covers rows [10-90), includes Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4*, 5
        BlockGroup4 - Covers rows [90-95), includes Blocks 1, 2*, 3, 5
        BlockGroup5 - Covers rows [95-100], includes Blocks 1, 3*, 5
        *special case - interval end==block group start

        An ideal solution would produce block groups like below. To do this against the IntervalTree
        library, we would need to know how to convert an inclusive range like ["bar", "foo"] into a
        range like ["bar", "fooa") where the end range is non-inclusive. It is fine for our block groups
        to be non-optimal, we just need code when zipper merging to detect if a block group's max key is
        less than the current iterator and therfore not consider it.

        Optimal block groups:
        BlockGroup1 - Covers rows [0-3), includes Blocks 1,5,4
        BlockGroup2 - Covers rows [3-10), includes Blocks 1,5,2,4
        BlockGroup3 - Covers rows [10-11), includes Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        BlockGroup3 - Covers rows [11-91), includes Blocks 1,2,3,5
        BlockGroup4 - Covers rows [91-96), includes Blocks 1,3,5
        BlockGroup5 - Covers rows [96-100], includes Blocks 1,5
